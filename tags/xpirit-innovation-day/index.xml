That&amp;rsquo;s a pretty high frequency. But Authority is our mission and we can only reach our goal by constantly pushing boundaries and exploring new techniques.
It&amp;rsquo;s also a way for us to connect with each other. Having good conversations while enjoying good food and drinks, makes for a great vibe. Do you want to know more about why we are doing Innovation Days?
Watch the video below. And would you like to embrace change, push your boundaries, and do epic assignments?
